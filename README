This is an optimized and parallel implementation of the sobel filter for bmp formatted images
****************************************************************************************************
To setup project run the cd into "s_image" and run "script"

$ ./script

You may need to set permissions with the following if you get an error

$ chmod +x script

Then cd to the main project directory. Here you can use the "Makefile" to compile the project

$ ./Makefile

Again you may have similar permission issues.

To execute make sure you are in a parallel environment then you can execute 

$ ./parallel_sobel

To execute the serial implementation on any environment 
$ ./serial_sobel

You can edit the number of images to operate on by modifying the value of "ITERS" at the top of the source code
